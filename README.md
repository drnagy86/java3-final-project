# Java3 Final Project
This is the final project for my CIS-181 Java III course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Deployment

## Project Setting
Project instructions: How to get it installed and running (TO BE FILLED OUT LATER)

## Chapters 1 and 2
I found learning how to use Tomcat really satisfying. I didn't really know anything about software development before enrolling in this program. The way the last semester was explained to me was that it would focus on creating servers. So, I have been really excited to see how that software is created. It was motivating to have that on the first day. Learning about deploying on the major cloud sites like AWS and Azure was also really interesting. Dev opps is really interesting and seems like a valuable skill.

## Chapter 3

In chapter 3, we learned about Servlets for Java. It was interesting to learn how to create Servlets with Intellij and how it creates the file for us with Java EE. I knew a little about requests and responses, and it was interesting to see how to access the information on the HTML page using methods like “getParameter”. It was also interesting to learn how to read the url to understand what is being passed to the Sevlet. Learning about the “@WebServlet” annotation was also useful for setting a url path or many of them.
