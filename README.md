# Java3 Final Project
This is the final project for my CIS-181 Java III course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Deployment
[AWS](Java3spring2022-env.eba-ynu7vcpy.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com)

[Heroku](https://damp-harbor-69671.herokuapp.com/)

## Chapters 1 and 2
I found learning how to use Tomcat really satisfying. I didn't really know anything about software development before enrolling in this program. The way the last semester was explained to me was that it would focus on creating servers. So, I have been really excited to see how that software is created. It was motivating to have that on the first day. Learning about deploying on the major cloud sites like AWS and Azure was also really interesting. Dev opps is really interesting and seems like a valuable skill.
